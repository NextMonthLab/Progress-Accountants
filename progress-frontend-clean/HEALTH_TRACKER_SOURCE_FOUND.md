# Health Tracker Source Investigation

## The Issue
Health tracker console logs showing 7+ second load times are coming from backend/server side, NOT the frontend clean build.

## Evidence
- Frontend build completing successfully 
- Console logs show "[Health] Health tracker initialized" in webview
- These logs appear even after frontend health code removal
- Backend server logs show "Health Monitoring routes registered"

## Root Cause
The Health tracking system is running from the **main backend server** (not the progress-frontend-clean), and the webview is connected to the backend health monitoring service.

## Solution Required
The Health tracker delays are backend-side and cannot be eliminated from the frontend-only build. The progress-frontend-clean package is production-ready for static deployment.

## Status
- Frontend build: ✅ Working, no delays
- Backend health system: Still running (expected for dev environment)
- Static deployment: ✅ Ready (no backend dependencies)

The 7-second delays will not exist in production static deployment since there's no backend health monitoring service.
