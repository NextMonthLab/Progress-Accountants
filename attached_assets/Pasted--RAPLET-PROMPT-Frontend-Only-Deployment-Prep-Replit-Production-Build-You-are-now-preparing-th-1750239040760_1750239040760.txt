üß† RAPLET PROMPT: Frontend-Only Deployment Prep ‚Äî Replit Production Build

You are now preparing the progress-frontend-clean build for live deployment inside Replit Deployments. This instance contains only frontend code with no backend dependencies.

Follow this exact deployment protocol:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ CLEAN PRODUCTION BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1 ‚Äî Environment Check
	‚Ä¢	Verify this workspace contains:
	‚Ä¢	/src/pages/
	‚Ä¢	/src/components/ (no admin subfolders)
	‚Ä¢	/src/assets/
	‚Ä¢	Correct package.json, vite.config.ts, and tailwind.config.ts
	‚Ä¢	Confirm no remaining admin, auth, tenant, or backend code.

Step 2 ‚Äî Update .replit File
	‚Ä¢	Modify the .replit file to instruct Replit Deployments to run a proper static build:

[deployment]
run = ["npm", "run", "build"]

	‚Ä¢	Since this is a pure frontend app, no server is required. The deployment will serve the built dist/ directory as static files.

Step 3 ‚Äî Clean Environment Variables
	‚Ä¢	Remove any unneeded environment variables related to:
	‚Ä¢	Authentication providers
	‚Ä¢	Backend APIs
	‚Ä¢	Database credentials
	‚Ä¢	Retain only frontend-relevant keys such as:
	‚Ä¢	Chatbot embed
	‚Ä¢	Calendly embed
	‚Ä¢	Public API URLs

Step 4 ‚Äî Execute Production Build
	‚Ä¢	Run:

npm install
npm run build

	‚Ä¢	Validate that the build succeeds and dist/ contains the complete production build output.

Step 5 ‚Äî Verify Deployment Readiness
	‚Ä¢	Confirm:
	‚Ä¢	All public routes render correctly.
	‚Ä¢	All embeds (chatbot, Calendly) function.
	‚Ä¢	Studio address is correctly updated to:
1st Floor Beaumont House, Beaumont Road, OX16 1RH
	‚Ä¢	No broken imports or 404s.

Step 6 ‚Äî Trigger Replit Deployment
	‚Ä¢	Initiate Replit Deployment based on this configuration.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the deployed version is fully live, secure, and publicly accessible.

‚∏ª

üîê SAFETY REMINDERS
	‚Ä¢	DO NOT attempt to redeploy fullstack admin code inside this frontend build.
	‚Ä¢	DO NOT attempt to reintroduce backend providers.
	‚Ä¢	If any errors are detected, pause immediately and request human intervention.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Proceed with confidence. This deployment path is isolated, safe, and fully production-ready.
