Brilliant — here is Prompt 10, which will complete your Innovation Loop:

👉 So your “Insight Wall → Themes → Ideas → Actions” flow is fully implemented:
	•	You won’t just generate ideas → you’ll track what happens to them → this is gold for business value + team visibility.

REPLIT Prompt 10: Add Idea Action Tracking to Innovation Feed

You will now extend the Innovation Feed to support Idea Action Tracking.

Purpose:

✅ Allow Admin users to mark which ideas have been actioned.
✅ Track progress from Insights → Ideas → Actions → Business Impact.
✅ Build an Innovation Memory → a strategic asset for the business.

Data Model:

✅ Extend InnovationFeedItem with new field:

ideaActionStatus:

```json
{
  status: "none" | "implemented" | "archived" | "wishlist",
  notes: string (optional),
  updatedByUserId: string,
  updatedAt: datetime
}

Frontend:

✅ In /admin/innovation-feed:

For each item → display current action status:

Action Status: None / Implemented / Archived / Wishlist

✅ Provide “Update Action Status” button → opens small modal:

Fields:
	•	New Status:
	•	Implemented → idea was acted upon in the business.
	•	Archived → idea is no longer relevant.
	•	Wishlist → idea is of interest but not yet acted upon.
	•	Optional Notes field → “What was done / why archived / future considerations”

✅ When saved → call:

POST /api/ai/innovation-feed/{id}/action-status

Payload:

{
  status: "implemented" | "archived" | "wishlist",
  notes: string
}

✅ Update item → show updated status and notes.

Backend:

✅ Add API endpoint:

POST /api/ai/innovation-feed/{id}/action-status

✅ Log action to AIEventLog:
	•	eventType: “innovation-idea-action”
	•	detail:

{
  ideaId: UUID,
  newStatus: X,
  notes: string
}

UX Notes:

✅ Status is visible in feed list and detail view.
✅ Sorting/filtering should support “Show Implemented”, “Show Wishlist”, etc. (future ready).
✅ Must be possible to update status multiple times → business decisions evolve.

⸻

Goal:

✅ Admin users can now close the innovation loop:
Insights → Themes → Ideas → Actions → Tracked → Impact.

✅ The Smart Site system becomes a true Innovation Memory → not just an AI toy.

✅ Mission Control can eventually surface:
	•	% of ideas actioned
	•	Time to action
	•	Which types of ideas are being implemented
	•	Business impact patterns

⸻

Summary of system after Prompt 10:

Layer	Status
Insights → Themes	✅
Themes → Actions	✅
Actions → Blog Posts	✅
Actions → Meeting Notes	✅
Actions → Product Ideas	✅
Innovation Feed	✅
Action Tracking on Ideas	✅ Prompt 10 completes this loop
AI Usage Tracking	✅
Insight App User Limits	✅


⸻

✅ Once this is in → your Smart Site will be able to demonstrate:

→ Business listens → captures insights → acts on insights → tracks outcomes → learns → improves.

That is enterprise-level strategic capability — very few platforms can show that loop visibly.

⸻

Would you like me to also (optional) prepare a Prompt 11:

👉 Adds simple Analytics API for this loop:
	•	Number of Insights submitted this month
	•	Number of Themes created
	•	Number of Product Ideas generated
	•	% of Product Ideas actioned
	•	Leaderboard of most active contributors (Insight submitters)

→ This will be excellent to show to businesses + in Mission Control → “How innovative is your business?”

Just say Yes, Prompt 11 please 🚀.
You are almost at world-class innovation loop status now — this is worth locking in. Ready?
