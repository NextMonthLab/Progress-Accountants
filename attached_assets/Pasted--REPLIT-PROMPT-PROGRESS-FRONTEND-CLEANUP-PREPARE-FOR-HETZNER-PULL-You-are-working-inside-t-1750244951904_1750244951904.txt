üß† REPLIT PROMPT ‚Äî PROGRESS FRONTEND CLEANUP + PREPARE FOR HETZNER PULL

‚∏ª

You are working inside the Progress-Frontend Clean Deployment Project.

The project has already been successfully deployed into Hetzner VPS as a standalone frontend-only container using Docker and nginx.

‚úÖ The following context applies:
	‚Ä¢	All admin, backend, and API services have been fully removed.
	‚Ä¢	This project now serves only public-facing static pages.
	‚Ä¢	Backend services (Admin Panel, Embeds, AI Features, Forms, API Calls) will be deployed separately as independent Pallet containers.
	‚Ä¢	Docker container expects the production build output inside:
./dist/public/index.html ‚Üí /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

‚∏ª

ü©∫ CURRENT ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING LIVE HETZNER DEPLOYMENT TEST:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Embed Codes:
	‚Ä¢	Many embed codes (chatbot, client dashboard, insights forms, calculators, etc) are currently calling routes or endpoints that no longer exist.
	‚Ä¢	These embed codes should be temporarily suppressed or replaced with non-functional placeholders.
	‚Ä¢	Leave clear TODO comments in code where future embed integrations will reconnect once backend Pallets are live.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Asset Optimization:
	‚Ä¢	Large images and hero sections are loading slowly due to unoptimized assets.
	‚Ä¢	Compress images, optimize formats (WebP where appropriate), and ensure all static assets are production-ready.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive Layout Bug:
	‚Ä¢	On mobile, horizontal scrolling drift occurs.
	‚Ä¢	Fully audit all container widths, flex/grid configs, and ensure strict viewport boundaries for mobile breakpoints.
	‚Ä¢	Zero horizontal scrolling allowed on mobile.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Help System Initialization Warning:
	‚Ä¢	Residual frontend modules are still trying to initialize backend help systems.
	‚Ä¢	These should be fully removed or disabled to prevent runtime warnings.

5Ô∏è‚É£ General Dependency Cleanup:
	‚Ä¢	Fully remove any remaining frontend libraries, hooks, or providers referencing now-defunct backend services.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure package.json contains only essential frontend packages.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure vite.config.ts fully supports pure static deployment.

‚∏ª

üßπ THE GOAL:

Prepare a fully hardened, production-ready static frontend build, suitable for pull-back into Hetzner.
Once complete, push all changes directly to the GitHub repo:

git@github.com:NextMonthLab/Progress-Accountants.git

The Hetzner deployment system will then:
	‚Ä¢	Pull updates directly
	‚Ä¢	Rebuild Docker container
	‚Ä¢	Serve the optimized frontend fully independent of any backend services.

‚∏ª

üöÄ This is part of Agora OS strict Pallet governance:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend = completely independent, CDN-safe, Dockerized static container.
	‚Ä¢	Backend + Embeds = separate Pallet deployments.
	‚Ä¢	Pallet Manager orchestrates connections later.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ When this task is complete:
	‚Ä¢	Notify that frontend is production-ready for Hetzner redeploy.
	‚Ä¢	System operator will execute full Hetzner Pull & Rebuild sequence.

‚∏ª

üîí Important:

Do not introduce any new dependencies requiring backend calls.
This Pallet is governed as a pure static frontend build.
