üß¨ RAPLET FRONTEND FINAL HARDENING PROMPT ‚Äî PROGRESS SMARTSITE (UPDATED)

‚ö† This version supersedes the prior one ‚Äî it includes the new critical mobile and containerized deployment specifications.

‚∏ª

üßπ CORE OBJECTIVE:

You are finalizing the production-grade frontend-only deployment package for the Progress SmartSite, targeting Hetzner VPS container infrastructure.
The build must operate as a fully independent static frontend without backend or admin dependencies.

‚∏ª

üîß TASKS TO EXECUTE:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Legacy System Removal:
	‚Ä¢	Fully delete any health system initialization logic.
	‚Ä¢	Remove Help System Initialization Failed logic entirely.
	‚Ä¢	Delete any startup backend discovery or readiness checks.
	‚Ä¢	Eliminate any asynchronous hydration delays tied to backend services.

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Pure Embed Model:
	‚Ä¢	All interactive features (forms, calculators, CRM dashboards, AI chat, Insight Hub, etc) must be rendered purely as iframe embed codes.
	‚Ä¢	The main frontend build must never attempt to load these directly via API calls ‚Äî the embed container handles this independently.
	‚Ä¢	If any iframe embed fails to load, the page must still render instantly and fully.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Layout Optimization:
	‚Ä¢	Fix horizontal drift: Apply permanent overflow-x: hidden to entire layout.
	‚Ä¢	Fix hero image scaling: Ensure hero section fully resizes on all viewport widths:
	‚Ä¢	No cropping of heads/feet on smaller screens.
	‚Ä¢	Full vertical scaling on mobile.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all sections remain fully bound to safe viewport width.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Asset Optimization:
	‚Ä¢	Compress any remaining large media assets, specifically:
	‚Ä¢	studio.jpg ‚Üí target under 500KB if visually acceptable.
	‚Ä¢	Apply lazy loading where applicable for optimal performance.

‚∏ª

5Ô∏è‚É£ Dependency Audit:
	‚Ä¢	Remove any legacy packages in package.json that supported removed backend logic.
	‚Ä¢	Resulting package.json should be pure static frontend only.

‚∏ª

6Ô∏è‚É£ Container Deployment Path:
	‚Ä¢	Output should be deployed to GitHub repo:

git@github.com:NextMonthLab/Progress-Accountants.git

	‚Ä¢	Ensure final build lives directly inside this target folder inside the repo:

/progress-frontend

	‚Ä¢	Do not alter or create nested folders (e.g. avoid structures like /client/dist/public).
	‚Ä¢	Output build must be directly consumable for nginx:alpine Docker container static serving.

‚∏ª

7Ô∏è‚É£ Rendering Verification:
	‚Ä¢	Test fully local static build.
	‚Ä¢	Verify:
	‚Ä¢	Full page renders in under 1 second.
	‚Ä¢	No horizontal drift.
	‚Ä¢	No backend-related console warnings.
	‚Ä¢	No help system errors.
	‚Ä¢	All embeds fail gracefully if remote service is unavailable.
	‚Ä¢	Mobile viewport fully contained and properly scaled.

‚∏ª

‚ö† STRICT RULE:
This is your final frontend-only hardened Pallet for Hetzner.
No new backend functionality should exist inside this repo.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Once complete: PUSH to GitHub. We will immediately pull down into Hetzner for final container rebuild.

‚∏ª

This is now fully bulletproof. üîí
