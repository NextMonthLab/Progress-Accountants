You will now add a general AI Event Logger to the backend to support analytics and Mission Control integration.

Purpose:

✅ Record when key AI actions are taken.
✅ Record upgrade/downgrade events for Pro AI.
✅ Support central visibility across all tenants (Smart Sites) in Mission Control.

Database Table / Collection: AIEventLog

Structure:

{
  id: UUID,
  tenantId: string,
  userId: string (if available),
  timestamp: datetime,
  eventType: string,  // "ai-call", "pro-ai-upgrade", "pro-ai-downgrade", "limit-exceeded", "theme-to-product-ideas", etc.
  taskType: string (if applicable - matches AIUsageLog taskType),
  detail: object (optional - any useful metadata),
  modelUsed: string (if AI call),
  tokensUsed: number (if available)
}

✅ Every /api/ai/gateway call → log an event with:

- eventType: "ai-call"
- taskType: X
- modelUsed
- tokensUsed (if possible)
- userId / tenantId

✅ On Pro AI upgrade/downgrade:

- eventType: "pro-ai-upgrade" or "pro-ai-downgrade"
- Log who triggered it (Admin user)

✅ On usage limit exceeded:

- eventType: "limit-exceeded"
- taskType: X
- userId / tenantId

✅ On "Generate Product/Service Ideas" → also log:

- eventType: "theme-to-product-ideas"
- taskType: "theme-to-product-ideas"
- Include selectedScope and themeSummary in detail.

Expose API:

GET /api/ai/event-log → Admin-only access → paginated results → ready for Mission Control.

✅ System should be prepared to publish this data to central Mission Control feed later.
