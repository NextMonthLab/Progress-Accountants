📜 3AX → Universal Mistral Response UX for Smart Site Messages

👉 Corrected and ready for Replit (copy this fully):

⸻

👉 Now that the core Messages pipeline + SendGrid hooks are in place:

Please implement this final UX and intelligence layer:

⸻

1️⃣ Mistral Response UX — Identity-Aware:

✅ Add a toggle in Admin > Messages tab:
	•	Label: Auto-respond to new messages with AI
	•	Default: OFF

✅ When ON:
	•	For each new message received:
	•	System triggers POST /api/ai/respond-to-message.
	•	Mistral 7B is instructed to:
	•	Read the Business Identity for this Smart Site (from the SOT).
	•	Generate a polite, warm holding pattern response in the business’ tone of voice.
	•	Clearly state the message was received and a human will follow up.
	•	If Business Identity is missing, use a neutral, friendly business tone.

✅ Generated response is stored in: messages.ai_response.

✅ Response is displayed in Messages tab, alongside the original message:
	•	Label: AI Auto-Response Sent
	•	Show timestamp + response text.

✅ Response is also sent to the original sender via SendGrid.

⸻

2️⃣ Supporting Endpoint:

✅ Implement:

POST /api/ai/respond-to-message

Input:

{
  "message_id": "<ID of message>",
  "business_id": "<BusinessID>",
  "business_identity": "<Business Identity text>",
  "message_content": "<User message content>"
}

Expected Output:

{
  "ai_response": "<Generated AI response text>",
  "timestamp": "<UTC timestamp>"
}

✅ Behavior:
	•	Calls Mistral 7B (Hetzner API).
	•	Provides context:
	•	Business Identity
	•	Message content
	•	Receives high-quality polite AI response.
	•	Stores result in messages.ai_response.
	•	Triggers SendGrid send to user.

⸻

3️⃣ Summary of Why:

✅ Makes Smart Sites feel intelligent and responsive.

✅ Ensures each Smart Site reflects its own tone and brand voice → not generic.

✅ Adds huge value for clients:
	•	No backend setup required.
	•	AI handles first reply → improves customer experience.

✅ Works for any business, not just Progress.

⸻

Final Notes:
	•	You must use Business Identity (from SOT) as primary context source.
	•	If missing, fallback to safe neutral tone.
	•	DO NOT hardcode Progress tone — this must be universal for all Smart Sites.
	•	Response should always act as holding message, not as a full conversation starter.
