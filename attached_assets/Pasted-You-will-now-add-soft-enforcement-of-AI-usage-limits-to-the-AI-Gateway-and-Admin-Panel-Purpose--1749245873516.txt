You will now add soft enforcement of AI usage limits to the AI Gateway and Admin Panel.

Purpose:

✅ Prevent unlimited Pro AI use beyond free or plan limits
✅ Provide a graceful fallback (Mistral or error message)
✅ Enable subscription upsells / AI credits in the future
✅ Provide clear UX when limits are reached

Backend (AI Gateway):

✅ On every /api/ai/gateway request:

- Check AIUsageLog for current month's usage for this tenant
- If IS_PRO_AI_USER is true:
    - Check against proAILimit (configurable, default 100 calls/month)
    - If under limit → allow call and log usage
    - If over limit → return:

    {
      status: "limit-exceeded",
      message: "You have reached your Pro AI usage limit for this month.",
      fallbackAvailable: true | false
    }

- If IS_PRO_AI_USER is false → allow Mistral call (no limit) → log usage

Frontend (Admin Panel):

✅ For each AI-enabled feature:

- If response status is "limit-exceeded":
    - Show modal or inline message:

    > "You've reached your Pro AI limit for this month.  
    > Upgrade your plan or wait until next month to continue using Advanced AI features."

✅ If fallbackAvailable is true:
    - Offer option:

    > "Use basic AI (Mistral 7B) instead."

    → If user accepts → send new request with forced fallback to Mistral.

✅ /admin/ai-settings:

- Show clear message if limit reached.
- Show CTA: "Upgrade to higher AI plan" (this can link to a placeholder for now).

Optional API additions:

✅ POST /api/ai/usage/fallback → log that user accepted fallback (optional tracking).

Config:

- proAILimit → configurable per tenant or global.
- fallbackAvailable → true by default (unless business decision changes).

Notes:

✅ Must NOT hard error → always offer user friendly message.
✅ Must gracefully fallback to Mistral where applicable.
✅ Must support future subscription system easily.
✅ "Upgrade" button can link to placeholder route or external subscription page.

Goal:

✅ The Admin Panel will now handle Pro AI usage limits cleanly.  
✅ Users will understand what is happening and can take action.  
✅ The system will not incur unexpected API costs.  
✅ You are now commercially ready to offer paid AI plans.

Please implement this logic now and ensure all AI-enabled features respect this flow.
