You will now add an Innovation Feed feature to the Smart Site Admin Panel.

Purpose:

✅ Provide Admin users with a persistent, evolving feed of:
- Product/Service Ideas generated from Themes
- (Future ready) Other Innovation prompts (Process Ideas, Partnership Ideas, etc.)

✅ Ensure ideas are easily revisited, shared, and built upon.
✅ Honour the original "Insight Wall → Themes → Ideas → Actions" flow.

Backend:

✅ Add new API endpoint:

GET /api/ai/innovation-feed

Response:

{
  items: [
    {
      id: UUID,
      timestamp: datetime,
      themeSummary: string,
      selectedScope: string,
      generatedByUser: string (if available),
      ideasMarkdown: string (full AI response used),
      taskType: string, // for now always "theme-to-product-ideas"
      modelUsed: string
    },
    ...
  ]
}

✅ When "Generate Product/Service Ideas" completes successfully:

- Save the full result to a new table / collection: InnovationFeedItem
- Structure:

{
  id,
  tenantId,
  userId,
  timestamp,
  themeSummary,
  selectedScope,
  ideasMarkdown (AI response),
  modelUsed,
  taskType ("theme-to-product-ideas")
}

✅ The feed should support:
- Pagination (10 items per page)
- Sorting by newest first

Frontend:

✅ Add new screen:

📍 /admin/innovation-feed → "Innovation Feed" in Admin Panel sidebar (under Insights or a new "Innovation" section)

✅ Display for each InnovationFeedItem:

- Date generated
- Theme Summary (short preview)
- Selected Scope
- User who triggered (if known)
- Model used (Mistral / ChatGPT)
- Full Ideas rendered from ideasMarkdown (support markdown rendering)
- Copy to clipboard button
- Export to Markdown / PDF button (optional, future)

UX Notes:

✅ Items should persist across sessions — this is not just an AI chat log, it is an Innovation Memory.

✅ Make clear this is a *creative support tool* — Admin users can revisit and build upon ideas over time.

✅ Support filtering in future:
- By scope
- By user
- By date range

✅ Support API export to Mission Control in future.

Goal:

✅ The Admin Panel will now have an "Innovation Feed" where Admin users can revisit all AI-generated Product/Service Ideas.  
✅ The system will progressively build an "Innovation Memory" for the business — a strategic asset.

✅ This will deeply align with the original Insight Wall → Themes → Ideas → Actions model of creative innovation.

Summary of Flow:

👉 **Insights → Themes → Actions → Innovation Feed → Business Impact**  
→ Beautiful creative loop.

---

Would you like me to also prepare an optional **Prompt 9**:

👉 Adds an **"Action Taken" Tracker** → so that Admin users can log when they have *implemented* an idea → closing the loop even further.

- Mark an Innovation Feed item as "Idea Implemented" → with notes.
- Shows on feed which ideas have been actioned.

This is extremely powerful for:
- Driving business value
- Reporting
- Team alignment

Just say **Yes, Prompt 9 please** 🚀.
