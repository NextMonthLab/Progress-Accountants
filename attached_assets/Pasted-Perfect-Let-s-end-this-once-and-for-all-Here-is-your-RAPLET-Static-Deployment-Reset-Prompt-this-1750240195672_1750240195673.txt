Perfect. Let‚Äôs end this once and for all.

Here is your RAPLET Static Deployment Reset Prompt ‚Äî this will surgically override any previous deployment issues and lock your clean frontend build into full static deployment mode inside Replit:

üß† RAPLET PROMPT: Static Deployment Reset ‚Äî Final Clean Frontend Production Mode

You are now executing a full deployment override for the progress-frontend-clean build.

‚∏ª

üîß Deployment Reset Protocol

1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify this workspace is frontend-only:
	‚Ä¢	No backend code
	‚Ä¢	No authentication providers
	‚Ä¢	No protected routes
	‚Ä¢	No tenant or admin logic
	‚Ä¢	All business calculator logic is fully client-side
	‚Ä¢	All advanced features (Chatbot, Calendly, etc.) are embedded via third-party embed codes

‚∏ª

2Ô∏è‚É£ Overwrite the .replit file with static deployment config:

[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "static"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = []

	‚Ä¢	This disables all backend/server runtimes.
	‚Ä¢	The deployment engine will build static files via npm run build and serve the /dist/ directory directly.

‚∏ª

3Ô∏è‚É£ Clean remaining deployment risk factors:
	‚Ä¢	Confirm package.json has no server or backend-only packages.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure all environment variables relate only to public frontend integrations.
	‚Ä¢	Verify no lingering npm start or development-specific workflow commands remain.
	‚Ä¢	Confirm Business Calculator PDF generation is handled client-side only.

‚∏ª

4Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Final Sanity Check:
	‚Ä¢	Run:

npm install
npm run build

	‚Ä¢	Confirm successful build output.
	‚Ä¢	Verify all frontend routes load without error.
	‚Ä¢	Verify updated studio address: 1st Floor Beaumont House, Beaumont Road, OX16 1RH is correct.
	‚Ä¢	Verify Chatbot embed and Calendly embed function correctly.

‚∏ª

üîê Safety Lock

If any unresolved backend dependencies are detected, pause immediately and request human operator confirmation before continuing deployment.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Proceed. This build is fully authorized for pure static deployment and should now successfully deploy on Replit with no further deployment blocks.

‚∏ª

üëâ Once you issue this, RAPLET will have zero excuse to keep blocking deployment.

‚∏ª

If you want, I can also generate you a ‚ÄúStatic Hetzner Container Prep Prompt‚Äù so you‚Äôre future-proofed for when you want to mirror this clean frontend into your Hetzner stack too.

Shall I generate that as well?
