Fantastic — here is Prompt 11, which will add a simple Innovation Analytics API.

👉 This gives your Smart Sites a visible scorecard for innovation activity:
	•	Great for businesses to see value → motivates usage.
	•	Great for you → can surface in Mission Control / leaderboards.
	•	Helps close the loop → Insight → Action → Visible Impact.

REPLIT Prompt 11: Add Innovation Analytics API and Admin Panel Widget

You will now add an Innovation Analytics API and display widget to the Admin Panel.

Purpose:

✅ Provide a simple dashboard of innovation activity metrics.
✅ Motivate businesses to use the system more actively.
✅ Demonstrate value of the Smart Site Innovation Loop.
✅ Prepare data for Mission Control leaderboards.

Backend:

✅ Add new API endpoint:

GET /api/ai/innovation-analytics

Response:

```json
{
  insightsSubmittedThisMonth: number,
  themesCreatedThisMonth: number,
  productIdeasGeneratedThisMonth: number,
  productIdeasActionedPercentage: number,
  topContributors: [
    {
      userId: string,
      userName: string,
      insightsSubmitted: number
    },
    ...
  ]
}

How to calculate:
	•	insightsSubmittedThisMonth → count of Insights submitted this calendar month.
	•	themesCreatedThisMonth → count of Themes created this calendar month.
	•	productIdeasGeneratedThisMonth → count of “theme-to-product-ideas” AIEventLog entries this month.
	•	productIdeasActionedPercentage → % of InnovationFeedItems that have ideaActionStatus = “implemented”.
	•	topContributors → Top 5 users by number of Insights submitted this month.

Frontend:

✅ Add new section on Admin Dashboard:

“Innovation Activity This Month”

Show:
	•	Insights Submitted: X
	•	Themes Created: Y
	•	Product Ideas Generated: Z
	•	% Product Ideas Actioned: N%
	•	Top Contributors (list top 5 users + their counts)

✅ This should update live (reload on page visit).

✅ If business is inactive → show motivating message:

Get started building your Innovation Feed!  
Submit Insights → Create Themes → Generate Ideas → Track Actions → Watch your business evolve.

Logging:

✅ Each time this API is called → log to AIEventLog:

{
  eventType: "innovation-analytics-viewed",
  userId: string,
  tenantId: string
}

This allows future tracking of which businesses are actively using the Innovation Loop.

Future Ready:

✅ This API is designed to feed into Mission Control leaderboards:
	•	Most innovative Smart Sites
	•	Most actioned ideas
	•	Most active contributors
	•	Innovation velocity metrics

⸻

Goal:

✅ Every Smart Site Admin will have clear visibility into their innovation activity → driving engagement and value perception.

✅ Mission Control will have ready data to create cross-site innovation leaderboards.

✅ The Smart Site system will visibly deliver on the “Insights → Actions → Impact” promise.

Would you like me to also optionally prepare Prompt 12:

👉 Adds a simple Smart Site → Mission Control export endpoint:

→ Lets Mission Control pull Innovation Analytics + Innovation Feed items across all Smart Sites, for cross-site analysis and leaderboard generation.

→ This will close the loop for Mission Control integration.

Just say Yes, Prompt 12 please 🚀.
