🚀 MASTER UNIFIED ACCOUNT & BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE PROMPT

(Ready to copy-paste to Replit)

We are now defining the Master Business Identity Architecture for the entire NextMonth ecosystem.

This architecture is MANDATORY for ALL NextMonth apps:

✅ NextMonth Home (marketing site + registration)  
✅ NextMonth SmartSite (Admin Panel)  
✅ NextGen Blog (public-facing content feed)  
✅ Insight App (Insight submission app for employees)  
✅ NextMonth Lab (Tool builder)  
✅ NextMonth Dev (Advanced dev tools / APIs)  
✅ SOT (Source of Truth — authoritative record of business state)

---

### CORE PRINCIPLE

✅ The universal glue of the system is **businessId** → also called tenantId.  
✅ All data in the system MUST be linked to tenantId.

No app should create or store data without linking it to a valid tenantId.

---

### MASTER FLOW

#### 1️⃣ Account Creation → Business Registration

✅ Happens on **NextMonth Home**:

- User enters email, password, businessName, industry, websiteURL → proceeds to payment.
- On successful payment:

```json
{
  userId: UUID,
  businessId (tenantId): UUID,
  email: userEmail,
  role: "admin",
  paymentStatus: "active",
  plan: "smart_site_basic",
  createdAt
}

✅ Business Profile MUST be written to SOT:

/businesses/tenantId/identity.json
{
  businessId: tenantId,
  businessName,
  industry,
  websiteURL,
  createdAt,
  adminUserId: userId,
  paymentStatus: "active",
  plan: "smart_site_basic"
}


⸻

2️⃣ Authentication (ALL Apps)

✅ All authenticated apps issue JWT tokens with this payload:

{
  userId: UUID,
  tenantId: UUID,
  role: "admin" | "editor" | "insightUser" | "labUser" | "devUser",
  exp: timestamp
}

✅ All API calls MUST carry this JWT → backend must scope all actions to tenantId.

⸻

3️⃣ SOT Structure

All apps must write their data into the SOT, under this directory:

/businesses/tenantId/
    identity.json
    users/admin-userId.json
    insight-users/insightAppUserId.json
    insights/insightId.json
    blog-posts/postId.json
    themes/themeId.json
    innovation-ideas/ideaId.json
    analytics-events/eventId.json
    ai-event-log/eventId.json
    tools/toolId.json  ← Lab + Dev

✅ No data should be written outside of this tenant-scoped structure.

✅ This ensures clean multi-tenant behavior and safe scaling.

⸻

4️⃣ App Responsibilities

✅ NextMonth Home:
	•	Implements signup → creates tenantId.
	•	Seeds SOT business profile.

✅ NextMonth SmartSite (Admin Panel):
	•	All actions scoped to tenantId from JWT.
	•	Admin can invite Insight App Users → insightAppUserId linked to tenantId.
	•	All content, Insights, AI Usage, Analytics must be written to SOT under tenantId.

✅ NextGen Blog:
	•	Public API MUST scope posts to /api/blog?tenantId=XYZ
	•	Must read only posts tagged to correct tenantId.

✅ Insight App:
	•	Insight App Users submit Insights → must include tenantId + insightAppUserId.
	•	Insights written to /businesses/tenantId/insights/.

✅ NextMonth Lab:
	•	All Tools built must be linked to tenantId.
	•	Tools stored in /businesses/tenantId/tools/.
	•	Tools surfaced in SmartSite Admin Panel for that tenantId only.

✅ NextMonth Dev:
	•	Same as Lab — advanced tools, APIs must be linked to tenantId and stored accordingly.

✅ SOT:
	•	Authoritative source of truth for ALL apps.
	•	No cross-tenant data leakage is allowed.
	•	All apps must respect tenantId when reading/writing to SOT.

⸻

5️⃣ Business Identity Locking

✅ Embed Code for Chat + Analytics:

<script src="https://smart.nextmonth.io/embed.js?tenantId=XYZ" async></script>

✅ NextGen Blog → scoped to tenantId.

✅ Insight App → submissions scoped to tenantId.

✅ NextMonth Lab + Dev → tools linked to tenantId → visible only in SmartSite Admin Panel for that tenant.

⸻

NON-NEGOTIABLE:

✅ ALL apps must adopt this model.
✅ No app may use its own notion of identity or store unlinked data.
✅ This ensures system-wide data integrity and multi-tenant scaling.

⸻

Final Notes:

✅ All apps will soon receive individual prompts to implement THEIR participation in this architecture.
✅ THIS PROMPT is to establish the shared SYSTEM CONTRACT across all apps first.

✅ Please acknowledge receipt and understanding of this architecture.

⸻

When you acknowledge this prompt, you must confirm:

✅ “I understand that all data must be scoped to tenantId.”
✅ “I understand that all API calls must include tenantId via JWT.”
✅ “I understand that the SOT is the authoritative source of truth and must be written to correctly.”
