# Manual Deployment Configuration Fix

## Issue
The deployment is blocked because the main .replit file contains development commands (`npm run dev`) which are flagged as security risks for production deployment.

## Solution: Manual .replit File Updates Required

You need to manually update the .replit file with these exact changes:

### 1. Change the main run command:
```
# Change this line:
run = "npm run dev"

# To this:
run = "npm start"
```

### 2. Update the deployment section:
```
# Change this:
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]

# To this:
[deployment]
deploymentTarget = "autoscale"
build = ["npm", "run", "build"]
run = ["npm", "start"]
```

### 3. Update workflow tasks:
```
# Change all instances of:
args = "npm run dev"

# To:
args = "npm start"
```

## After Making These Changes
1. The website will build using production commands
2. Deployment security checks will pass
3. The clean frontend (186MB) will serve correctly
