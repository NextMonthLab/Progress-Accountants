# Production Deployment Guide

## Current Issue
The deployment is failing because the .replit file is configured for development (`npm run dev`) rather than production.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION: Deploy Clean Frontend

The `progress-frontend-clean/` directory is ready for deployment:
- Build successful
- All dependencies resolved
- Zero admin functionality
- Production-ready static files

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use the Clean Frontend (Recommended)
The `progress-frontend-clean/` directory contains a production-ready static website that can be deployed independently:

```bash
cd progress-frontend-clean
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to any static hosting service
```

### Option 2: Update Deployment Configuration
You need to manually update the .replit file to use production commands:

1. Change the deployment run command from `npm run dev` to:
   ```
   run = ["sh", "-c", "npm run build && npm start"]
   ```

2. The package.json already has the correct production scripts:
   - `npm run build` - builds the application
   - `npm start` - runs the production server

### Option 3: Environment Variables
For production deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `DATABASE_URL` (already configured)
- Any required API keys

## Recommended Approach
Since you have a clean frontend extraction ready, I recommend deploying that separately as a static website while keeping the full system for admin functionality.

The clean frontend in `progress-frontend-clean/` is:
- Completely independent
- Production-ready
- No admin dependencies
- Perfect for public website hosting
