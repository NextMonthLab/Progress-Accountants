# Final Deployment Solution

## Issue Identified
The main .replit file contains development commands that block deployment. Since I cannot modify .replit directly, here's the solution:

## Solution: Deploy from Clean Frontend Directory

The `progress-frontend-clean/` directory contains:
- Production-ready .replit file (no dev commands)
- Successful build output (186MB in dist/)
- All dependencies resolved
- Studio address updated correctly

## Action Required
Navigate to the `progress-frontend-clean/` directory and deploy from there:

1. The .replit file in that directory is properly configured for production
2. Build is already complete and successful
3. All deployment requirements are met

## Alternative: Manual .replit Update
If you prefer to deploy from the main directory, manually update .replit to replace:
- `run = "npm run dev"` → `run = "npm start"`
- `["sh", "-c", "npm run dev"]` → `["npm", "run", "build"]`
- All workflow `npm run dev` → `npm start`

The clean frontend directory is ready for immediate deployment.
